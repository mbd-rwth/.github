# Methods for Model-based Development in Computational Engineering

Our chair was founded by Professor Kowalski in August 2021. The group's research focuses on innovative methods for model-based development and decision support. This includes predictive process simulations as well as sustainable digital infrastructure and federated model and data architectures.

`PSimPy` (Predictive and probabilistic simulation with Python) implements a Gaussian process emulation-based framework that enables systematic and efficient investigation of uncertainties associated with physics-based models (i.e. simulators).

### SHIRE

`SHIRE` (Susceptibility Hazard mappIng fRamEwork) is a tool to facilitate and streamline landslide susceptibility and hazard mapping using a Random Forest classifier. It provides support for repetitive steps in landslide susceptibility and hazard mapping such as input dataset generation including data pre-processing.
It is a Python-based modular framework that can be complemented with individual modules necessary for answering individual mapping challenges due to the open-access nature of the code.

### pyresice

`pyresice` contains the software used to create the Reusability-targeted Enriched Sea Ice Core Database (RESICE) and can be used to extend or reproduce the database.

## Courses

### CMM: Continuum Mechanical Modeling for Simulation Science

This lecture provides an introduction to continuum mechanical modeling from the perspective of simulation science and computational engineering. Offered since 2024, the lecture is a re-titled and re-designed version of the lecture ‘From Molecular to Continuum Physics II’, which was offered 2023 and 2022.

### SCE: Sustainable Computational Engineering

Sustainable Computational Engineering introduces into the elements of data life cycle and model development cycle to students interested in data-integrated and potentially high-throughput modelling tasks. The complementary exercise intensifies content of the lecture with theoretical and application-oriented examples.
The lecture is offered since 2022.
